**Krautsynch Bot** (c) Berndboy2

This is the KrautsynchBot from elektrojude.com
written in C# in a windows-forms application with browser-control.
Warning, this code is very shitty readable, full of unnecessary comments, most of comments are todos and it was all written while i was drunk, lol.

Its heavily recommend you are specifying the Browser -Control to the newest Internet Explorer 11, explained here:
